% Conclusion chapter

Cluster Web, a web-based tool used in Cluster II mission operations, is overviewed in this thesis, as well as the reasons why a modernized version, OpsWeb, needed to be developed to improve usability and to support other missions. The development process, technical architecture and new features of OpsWeb are detailed in this thesis. 

The differences in usability and user experience between Cluster Web and OpsWeb were studied through an user evaluation. Overall, the results are positive, thanks to the improved user interface and software architecture of OpsWeb. Problems discovered during the evaluation are overviewed. Some parts of the evaluation did not yield statistically significant results. In particular, the effect of configurable timeline visualizations on usability could be studied in more detail in future research.

The author of this thesis contributed to the development of OpsWeb during a six-month internship at the European Space Operations Centre in 2017. OpsWeb is under ongoing development as of early 2018, and is planned to be taken into use outside of Cluster II mission, initially with Sentinel 5P routine operations and BepiColombo mission simulations. Evidently there is demand for easy-to-use web interfaces for supporting mission operations, and taking usability into account during the development is very important.
